\title{Load All Course Datasets}
\usage{
load_course_data(verbose = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{verbose}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), prints messages about
which datasets have been loaded.}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns \code{NULL}. Datasets are loaded into the global
environment as side effects.
}
\description{
Convenience function to load all datasets used in the Model Selection and
Model Simplification course into the global environment. This is useful for
quick setup at the beginning of a session.
}
\details{
Currently loads the following datasets:
\itemize{
\item \code{ames}: Ames housing data (from \code{\link{ames_housing}})
}

Additional datasets will be added as the course develops.
}
\note{
This function modifies the global environment by creating objects.
For a more functional approach that doesn't modify the global environment,
use the individual accessor functions like \code{\link{ames_housing}}.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Load all course datasets at once
library(msmsr)
load_course_data()

# Now 'ames' is available in your environment
head(ames)
}
}
