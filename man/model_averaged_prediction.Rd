\title{Model-averaged prediction}
\usage{
model_averaged_prediction(models, comparison, newdata)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of fitted model objects with \code{predict} methods.}

\item{comparison}{A tibble from \code{model_table()} containing a \code{weight}
column with Akaike weights and a \code{model} column with model names.}

\item{newdata}{A data frame of predictor values for which to make predictions.
Must contain all variables used in any of the models.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
\describe{
\item{predictions}{Tibble with model name, individual prediction, and weight}
\item{averaged}{Numeric scalar: the model-averaged prediction}
}
}
\description{
Computes a weighted average of predictions from multiple models using
Akaike weights. This accounts for model selection uncertainty by
combining predictions across the set of candidate models.
}
\details{
The model-averaged prediction is calculated as:
\deqn{\hat{y}_{avg} = \sum_{i=1}^{R} w_i \hat{y}_i}
where \eqn{w_i} is the Akaike weight for model \eqn{i} and \eqn{\hat{y}_i}
is its prediction. This provides a prediction that accounts for uncertainty
about which model is correct.

\examples{
models <- list(
  m1 = lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars),
  m2 = lm(mpg ~ wt + hp, mtcars)
)
comparison <- msmsr::model_table(models)
newdata <- data.frame(wt = 3.0, hp = 150)
model_averaged_prediction(models, comparison, newdata)
