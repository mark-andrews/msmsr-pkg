\title{Calculate variable importance from model averaging}
\usage{
variable_importance(models, comparison)
}
\arguments{
\item{models}{A named list of fitted model objects (e.g., \code{lm} objects).}

\item{comparison}{A tibble from \code{model_table()} containing model
comparison statistics including a \code{weight} column with Akaike weights.}
}
\value{
A tibble with two columns:
\describe{
\item{variable}{Name of the predictor variable}
\item{importance}{Sum of Akaike weights for models containing this variable}
}
Sorted in descending order of importance.
}
\description{
Computes the importance of each variable as the sum of Akaike weights
across all models that contain that variable. This provides a measure
of how strongly the data support including each predictor.
}
\details{
Variables with importance close to 1 appear in all well-supported models.
Variables with importance near 0 appear only in poorly-supported models.
Intermediate values indicate the variable appears in some but not all
competitive models, suggesting uncertainty about its inclusion.

models <- list(
  m1 = lm(mpg ~ wt, mtcars),

  m3 = lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + cyl, mtcars)
)
